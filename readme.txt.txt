About the test:


- The api you indicated has some restriction problems with the free plan, so I decided to switch to another API that does the same thing. (https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/)
- I already left the api calls with my access key to help you analyze the solution
- the project was created in angular, I chose version 8, because it is a not so old version and very common in most current angular projects
- to build the solution type de commands: 
	npm install
	npm start
